<identifier> HEXA

Result:  
Negative (no lupus anticoagulant detected); see comment.

Comment:

The Lupus Anticoagulant by HEXA test is NEGATIVE for lupus anticoagulant according to the manufacturer's guidelines for interpretation.

A negative test result in this assay does not exclude the possibility of a lupus anticoagulant.  Current guidelines suggest testing for lupus anticoagulant with two clot based tests (J Thromb Haemost 2009; 7: 1737-40) and it is noted that the concurrent RVVT assay is <rvvt_result>in this patient.  Lupus anticoagulant testing should be considered positive if one of the two tests gives a positive result. <both_neg>

Testing for lupus anticoagulant in the presence of anticoagulant therapy (including warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors & direct factor 10a inhibitors, and supratherapeutic heparin) is not recommended due to possible interference with test results.  The presence of factor deficiencies or a factor specific inhibitor may also interfere with this assay.  Clinical correlation is advised.

Test results must be interpreted in their clinical context if a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is being considered.  J Thromb Haemost 2006; 4: 295-306 provides consensus guidelines for diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.
