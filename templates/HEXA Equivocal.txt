Equivocal; see comment.

Comment:

The Lupus Anticoagulant by HEXA test is at the border between a negative and a positive result.  The results are therefore EQUIVOCAL.  If clinically indicated and at an appropriate time, the Lupus Anticoagulant by HEXA test could be repeated.

Current guidelines suggest testing for lupus anticoagulant with two clot based tests (J Thromb Haemost 2009; 7: 1737-40) and it is noted that the concurrent RVVT assay is <rvvt_result> in this patient.  Lupus anticoagulant testing should be considered positive if one of the two tests gives a positive result.

Testing for lupus anticoagulant in the presence of anticoagulant therapy (including warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors & direct factor 10a inhibitors, and supratherapeutic heparin) is not recommended due to possible interference with test results.  The presence of factor deficiencies or a factor specific inhibitor may also interfere with this assay.  Clinical correlation is advised.

Test results must be interpreted in their clinical context if a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is being considered.  J Thromb Haemost 2006; 4: 295:306 provides consensus guidelines for diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.
