Current guidelines suggest testing for lupus anticoagulant with two clot based tests (J Thromb Haemost 2009; 7: 1737-40) and it is noted that the concurrent lupus anticoagulant by HEXA assay is <hexa_result> in this patient.  Lupus anticoagulant testing should be considered positive if one of the two tests gives a positive result.

Testing for lupus anticoagulant in the presence of anticoagulant therapy (including warfarin, direct thrombin inhibitors & direct factor 10a inhibitors, and supratherapeutic heparin) is not recommended due to possible interference with test results.  The presence of factor deficiencies or a factor specific inhibitor may also interfere with this assay.  Clinical correlation is advised.  

Test results must be interpreted in their clinical context if a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is being considered.  J Thromb Haemost 2006; 4: 295–306 provides consensus guidelines for diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.
